# MONRP
Multi/Many-Objective Next Release Problem

This research aims to solve the multi-objective next release optimization problem (MONRP) for the trade-off between feature selection, resource allocation, and minimization of cost for the future release of a software system which helps to find the best option to meet customer needs as well as commercial profit for the software industry. To provide quality services as well as customer satisfaction, software companies usually provide up to date versions of their dedicated software platform to the customers with the most desirable features. Software companies usually build, develop, and maintain software systems that are large, complete, and very much needed by the community. For this reason, software companies often face the dilemma of deciding what improvements or requirements should be applied in further development or Next Release. Typically, the NRP can be regarded as an example of the problem of finding a subset of future selections. In NRP, a single objective formulation has the disadvantage that the optimization of one objective can be achieved at the expense of other objectives, which results in the search for bias in certain parts of the solution space.
